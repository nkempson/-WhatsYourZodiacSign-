This repository is to aid as the milestones that will serve to the project




WEEK 1: 
This week I am deciding whether to use Visual Studio, Vim or PyCharm to code this program
I managed to accomplish a small portion of the code and will begin placement as soon as I choose the application to use 


Week 2: I have decided to use PyCharm as my editor and have begun learning the program. I watch videos to assist with the correct input for my code.


Week 3: I have written majority of the code and I am deciding whether I can get the pictures as precise as I can. Otherwise, I will try a different method.
